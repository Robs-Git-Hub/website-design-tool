styles.core_characteristics = [
  "Strong reliance on a grid system to align and organize elements, creating a consistent structure across the layout",
  "Use of sans-serif typefaces with clear typography rules for maximum legibility",
  "Minimal ornamentation: very limited use of illustration or decoration; photography or simple color blocks are used sparingly to support content",
