# ======================================================================
# SITE BUNDLE SCHEMA (v0.3.0)
# ======================================================================
# Purpose:
# - Defines the structure of the `site_bundle.toml` payload.
# - Acts as the "Target Output" for the Orchestrator LLM.
#
# CRITICAL RULE ON COMMENTS:
# - Comments in the bundle must explain RATIONALE ("Why this decision?").
# - Comments must NOT contain IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ("How to build it?").
# - BAD: tone = "serious" # Use #000000 and 12px font.
# - GOOD: tone = "serious" # To convey authority and trust.
#
# *Violating this rule breaks the separation between Vibe and Coal Face.*
