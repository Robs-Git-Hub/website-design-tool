# Stage A: The Input (Unrefined Idea)

The input to the system is designed to be **flexible and multimodal**. Users can provide:

- **Description** — Natural language expressing aesthetic intent ("sleek and modern", "like Apple but darker")
- **Website screenshot** — An image of an existing website as reference
- **Other inspiration** — Images such as mood boards, photography, or artwork
- **Website URL** — A link to an inspirational site (for screenshot capture or code inspection)
- **Any combination** of the above

The system accepts raw, unstructured human intent and translates it into a structured [Stage B: Vibe Spec](../stage_b_vibe_spec/).
