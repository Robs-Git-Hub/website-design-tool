# The Skeleton (Layout Blueprint)

**Structural layout specifications that define the anatomy of a website.**

---

## Purpose

The Skeleton translates user context and WAS bundle into layout structures:

- **Page hierarchy** — Header, Hero, Sections, Footer
- **Component layout** — Grids, sidebars, cards, navigation
- **Interaction patterns** — Modals, dropdowns, accordions
- **Responsive rules** — Breakpoints, stacking behavior

---

## Target Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `blueprint.toml` | WAS Blueprint specification |
| SDUI JSON | Server-Driven UI compatible format |

---
