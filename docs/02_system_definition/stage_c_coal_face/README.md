# Stage C: Coal Face Execution Specs

The **Coal Face** is where abstract aesthetic intent becomes concrete implementation specs. The WAS Bundle (Stage B) is compiled into domain-specific specifications for "Worker Agents."

---

## The Four Execution Specs

| Spec | Description | Target Formats |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| [The Skin](./the_skin_theme/) | Design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) | W3C Design Tokens, Tailwind |
| [The Skeleton](./the_skeleton_blueprint/) | Layout structure (components, hierarchy) | SDUI JSON, Relume-style blueprints |
| The Imagery | Visual briefs for image generation | Midjourney prompts *(future)* |
| The Copy | Tone-of-voice guidelines | Copywriting LLM prompts *(future)* |

---

## Current Status

- **The Skin** — Research pending (W3C Design Tokens spec)
- **The Skeleton** — Research complete (see [existing schema comparisons](./the_skeleton_blueprint/research/))
- **The Imagery** — Not yet started
- **The Copy** — Not yet started
